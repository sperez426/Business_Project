After analytzing some of the customer's data, I found that customers that make the most wine purchases on average range between the ages 40 to 55 with an average income of 45k to 51k. It is important to note that customers in their mid to late 20s purchased the least amount of wine and had the highest average income. Could be a potential market to tap into, but more data is required. After creating the visuals for this data, I found a few outliers that had ages above 100 which need to be removed.
