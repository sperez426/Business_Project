Business Project Proposal

Question/need:

What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
Idependently owned liquor stores are struggling to compete with large retailers, stay up to trends, and maximize their profits. How can a liquor store improve their alcohol selection to attract and maintain customers?

Problem type?
Prescription and relationship

Impact Hypothesis:

What is the impact?
By creating a recommendation engine to improve alcohol selection related to demographic and trends, the hypothesis is that the liquor store will improve sales and customer retention. 

Scope:

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
Liquor store owner

What is the solution path?
First steps: Filter wine data to find prices that best suit income level of clientele 


What are the constraints?
- Owner may not have access to all needed distributors
- Liquor store sells more than just wine so further analysis in other types of liquor would be needed

Data Description:

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
Red and White wine data from Kaggle and demographic data. Would like to implement marketing client data from Kaggle as well.

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
Analysis of country, winery, rating, number of ratings, price, year, income earning.

What is the measurement of success?
Increase amount of wine spent 

Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
Use google sheets to import my data and preform exploratory analysis. Use tableau to visualize findings.

MVP:

For my MVP, I plan submit an updated hypothesis and solution path as well as a supporting visual of my EDA.
