## Liquor Store Analysis
Sheralee Lovejoy

### Abstract
The purpose of this project is to help a liquor store owner find ways to increase sales so he can hire a store manager. This will allow him to spend less time at work and more with his family.

### Design
For this project, data was collected from Kaggle and primarily focused on the store's customer transactions for the year 2015. Using the scoping method, I was able to determine my impact hypothesis as well as the solution path to achieve proposed hypothesis.


### Data
The dataset, collected from Kaggle, contains 9000+ rows of customer transactions and 2000+ rows of marketing campaign information. Some of the features I analyzed were age, income, retail cost, wholesale cost, bottles sold, sale, and item description.

### Algorithms

- VLOOKUP
- IF
- Calculate Feilds
- Remove Outliers
- Grouping Products
- Pandas to filter one store during one year

#### Impact Hypothesis
Improving alcohol selection and identifying opportunity within customers will increase net profit to support hiring a store manager.

#### Solution Path
- Clean/Analyze/Interpret Data
- Determine which age group/ income level visits are more recent (opportunity for growth)
- Identify what products are selling most/least
- Calculate if spirit selection could be improved

#### Models
Using tableau, I created a distrubtion chart to better understand the age and income distrubtion of customers. In addition, I created a pie chart to visualize how much of products selling less than 8 bottles made up the entire product inventory.

#### Final Solutions:

##### Customer Segmentation
- separating your customers into groups based on age and income
- Potential growth opportunity in age group of 30
- Better understanding of customers to teget marketing better
##### Demand Forecasting
- Create predictive model using regressions to determine product demand for following year
- Time Series analysis 
- Potentially eliminating products that sold less than 8 bottles

##### Margin Increase
- 1% margin increase could potentially increase profit by $30,457.59
